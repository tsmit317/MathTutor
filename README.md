# MathTutor
MathTutor is a GUI application developed to help students practice math problems. The application allows user to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Additionally, users are able to set the difficulty of the math problem. Upon submission, the users submission is highlighted in green if correct and red if incorrect.
A history of problems attempted is available while the program is running.

### Motivation
MathTutor was created in the Fall of 2015 as a project for ITCS 3112 - Design and Implementation of Object Oriented Systems at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 
The objective of the project was to demonstrate a GUI app using Java components and to create GUI objects along with the collection framework.

* Students are be able to choose the level on which s(he) wishes to work. 
* In addition, the student is able to choose the problem type that s(he) wishes to do: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. 
* A history of the students work, containing the difficulty level, problem, students answer, and correct answer, can be viewed at any time 
while the program is running. 

### Difficulty Levels
